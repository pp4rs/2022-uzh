!!! tip
    Please try and install all the software before the course begins.
    If you are struggling we are able to help - but we expect you have tried to work through the guide yourself.

    Drop us an email (see summary above), if you need help.

## Slack Chat

Throughout the course we will post useful tidbits of information, and answer questions that are slightly off topic in a web-chat environment called Slack.

Instructions on how to join our Slack chat will be distributed closer to the course start date.
