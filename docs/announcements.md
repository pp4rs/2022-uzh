!!! bug "Final Assignment"
    *Date Posted: 2021-09-27*

    Detail about the course assignment:

    * Due date: Friday, October 29th at 23:59.
    * Discuss with one of us your proposed assignment before you start
        * We can evaluate whether it is do-able within the time frame
        * Don't try and be too fancy, it's more important that it works
    * The assignment must:
        - Do some form of data cleaning / manipulation as part of the workflow
            - The initial "dataset" cannot be the one that generates the regression / figures
        - Produce at least one figure and one table of results that are saved to file
        - Use `Snakemake` to execute the workflow
    * Submission format: Invite @lachlandeer *and* @julianlanger to collaborate on your GitHub repository by the due date.
        * This means, we expect well version controlled work.
        * Tag your final submission using the following git command `git tag -a 1.0 -m "submitted version"`
        * You must have a README.md in the main directory with instructions on how we can build the assignment & what it does.
    * Explictly document somewhere what packages we need to install so that your assignment runs on our machine with no issues.
    * Your assignment must execute by us typing:
        * `snakemake --cores 1 all`
  
      into a terminal that is opened into your project's directory
    
    * To pass the course:
        *  Your code must build without errors via Snakemake (unless we find something really weird, then we will reach out to you)
        * The project must be version controlled, with each contributor making commits. One final commit is not enough.
        * Inputs and outputs must be in separate folders. -->

    Welcome to the course "Programming Practices for Research in Economics."

    Please take a look around the [course website](https://pp4rs.github.io/2022-uzh) before the course begins. All the latest information about the course contents, schedule and course locations (which may vary day-by day!) are available on these pages.

    We particularly draw your attention to the:

    *  **[Installation Guide](https://pp4rs.github.io/installation-guide/)**. These pages walk you through the steps needed to install all the software for the course.
        * We expect you to have completed it before the course begins.
        * We are offering help to individuals struggling with the steps involved in the installation guide in a 'Help Session' before the course begins: Wednesday, September 1st. Time and location are TBA.
            * We expect you have tried to complete the guide yourself, and we will not be there to do it all for you.
            * The guide is modular in nature - with most steps being independent of those before and after.
            * For Windows users there are a couple of sections that are still being developed. They should be complete before September 1.
    * **[Pre-Course Survey](https://forms.gle/ZrxzytvKrjmE8rFs8)**.
        * Please fill this out before the course begins.

    To avoid clogging up everyone's inboxes with course email, all future important information will be posted on the course's [Announcements page](https://pp4rs.github.io/2022-uzh/announcements) - be sure to check in there regularly. Smaller pieces of information and course chat will take place inside a chat environment, called [Slack](https://www.slack.com). Sign up to join the conversation [here](https://pp4rs.slack.com).

    We look forward to seeing you on the first day of classes on Thursday, September 2nd, at 9.30am.

    Best,

    Martin and Julius
